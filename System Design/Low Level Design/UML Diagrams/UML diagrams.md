UML diagrams are split into two main types: ***Structural Diagrams***, showing static system parts (Class, Component, Deployment, Object, Package, Composite Structure, Profile), and ***Behavioral Diagrams***, showing dynamic system functions (Use Case, Activity, State Machine, Sequence, Communication, Interaction Overview, Timing). Structural diagrams focus on _what_ the system is, while behavioral diagrams focus on _how_ it works and interacts over time.

## Structural Diagrams (Static View)
These diagrams represent the physical structure and relationships within a system.

- Class Diagram: Shows classes, attributes, operations, and relationships (most common).
- Component Diagram: Views the system's physical components and their dependencies.
- Deployment Diagram: Maps software artifacts to hardware nodes (physical environment).
- Object Diagram: A snapshot of instances (objects) at a specific time, like a class diagram with real data.
- Package Diagram: Organizes model elements into groups (packages).
- Composite Structure Diagram: Details the internal structure of classifiers (like classes).
- Profile Diagram: Extends UML for specific domains (profiles/stereotypes).

## Behavioral Diagrams (Dynamic View)
These illustrate the dynamic aspects and flow of control or data in a system.

- Use Case Diagram: Shows actors (users) and their interactions (use cases) with the system.
- Activity Diagram: Models the flow of activities and workflows, similar to flowcharts.
- State Machine Diagram: Shows an object's states and transitions triggered by events.
- Sequence Diagram: Focuses on message sequences between objects over time.
- Communication Diagram: Highlights message passing and object relationships (similar to collaboration diagrams).
- Interaction Overview Diagram: Combines activity and sequence diagrams to show control flow.
- Timing Diagram: Details object state changes over specific time periods. [[2](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/uml-diagram-types-examples/), [7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqT_qGgoZbw), [9](https://www.softwareideas.net/c/1059/uml-diagrams), [10](https://tallyfy.com/uml-diagram/)]
