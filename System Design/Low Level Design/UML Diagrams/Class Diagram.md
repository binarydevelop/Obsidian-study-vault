# UML Class Diagrams (Deep Dive)

## What is a Class Diagram?
A **class diagram** shows:
- The **static structure** of a system
- **Classes**
- Their **data (attributes)**
- Their **behavior (methods)**
- **Relationships** between classes

Think of it as:
> “What are the building blocks of my system, and how are they connected?”
