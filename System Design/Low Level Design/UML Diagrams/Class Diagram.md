## UML Class Diagrams

### What is a Class Diagram?
A **class diagram** shows:
- The **static structure** of a system
- **Classes**
- Their **data (attributes)**
- Their **behavior (methods)**
- **Relationships** between classes

Think of it as:
> “What are the building blocks of my system, and how are they connected?”

A class is drawn as a **rectangle divided into 3 parts**:
```markdown
-----------------
| Class Name    |
-----------------
| Attributes    |
-----------------
| Methods       |
-----------------
```
